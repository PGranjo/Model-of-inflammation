# Project Aim

The study aimed to describe the molecular response of human skin fibroblasts to inflammatory insults to validate them as an adequate model for the study of the immune response, when accessing immunopathology, particularly in cases where cellular and animal model organisms are scarce. Three healthy skin fibroblasts were stimulated with TNF-α and the transcriptome was profiled by RNA-Seq. Data were validated by accessing the levels of proteins associated with the identified pathways and processes, by combining immunodetection assays.
